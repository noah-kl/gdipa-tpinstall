# gdipa-tpinstall
gdipa-tpinstall (short for Geometry Dash IPA Texture Pack Installer) is a simple python program made to somewhat simplify the process of installing a texture pack into a Geometry Dash IPA.
# Honesty is Key
1: This is my first Python program, I have just made it for fun. I understand that it is not that sophisticated and can be easily replicated with and without Python.
2: I have not tested the IPAs that are made by this at all! I am lazy brother.
# How to use?
###### 1: Install Python
Python can be installed from https://www.python.org/ or from the Microsoft Store.
###### 2: Get a Geometry Dash IPA
Please do not pirate this game, buy it before you find an IPA for it, it is literally 2 dollars. Once you have the IPA, I reccomend putting it in the same folder as gdipa-tpinstall.
###### 3: Get a Texture Pack
Find a texture pack on the internet to use for the installation, keep in mind only medium texture packs work.
###### 4: Open CMD and CD to the gdipa-tpinstall directory
It will likley be in your downloads folder, so run a command similar to "cd downloads/gdipa-tpinstall"
###### 5: Run the program in cmd
The command to run it should be "python3 gdipa-tpinstall.py"
